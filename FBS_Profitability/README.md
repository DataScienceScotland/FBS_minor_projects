# FBS_Profitability
R code to reproduce Aspects of the Farm Profitability Report.

The profitability report is here: https://www.gov.scot/publications/farm-business-survey-2018-19-profitability-scottish-farming/

The intention was to turn this into a RAP project which would automatically create a similar report each year, but I couldn't quite replicate some of the numbers in the report so wasn't sure I had the methodolgy correct, and then ran out of time.
