# FBS_volunteers

This project contains R code to do basic QA analysis on whether farms which proactively volunteer for the survey are comparable with farms which are brought in through the normal recruitment process.

At the moment, it uses a manually created list of voluntary farms for the 2022 sampyear, provided by SACC separately from the main data drops. The code should be updated to use the new FI_volunteer flag in the farm_information table.
