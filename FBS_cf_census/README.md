# FBS_cf_census
Code for producing reports on how the Farm Business Survey sample compares to the June Census sample 

Two reports are created - a main report and a separate report identical to the main report but with an additional appendix looking at BRN/holdings data. The additional appendix should only be shared internally.

This code should be run after FBS publication. Store the reports in that year's FBS eRDM folder, and send links to the Agriculture, Food and Drink Analysis unit.
