# FBS_Fertiliser
R code to process and analyse input costs (mainly fertiliser, but also fuel/electricity) from Farm Business Survey data.


It should be run for QAing the FBS data, but needs the weights to be done first.

Input data on fertiliser costs currently needs to be entered manually each year, sourced from the John Nix handbook and Defra's annual British Survey of Fertiliser Practice publication.
