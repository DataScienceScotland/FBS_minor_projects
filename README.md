# FBS_minor_projects

This repository contains all the R projects for the Farm Business Survey which aren't big enough to justify their own repository. There should be one project per folder, each with its own RProj and readme files. Use each project's specific RProj file to run its code.

The projects are:

* FBS_cf_census
* FBS_CN_analysis
* FBS_CXC
* FBS_FBI_distributions
* FBS_input_costs
* FBS_Profitability
* FBS_QA
* FBS_selection_plan
* FBS_volunteers

Other FBS-related projects, with their own repository are:

* [FBS_R_weightings](https://github.com/DataScienceScotland/FBS_R_Weighting)
* FBS dashboard [link]
