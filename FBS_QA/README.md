# FBS_QA

This project contains R code for QAing initial FBS data (pre-weighting).

It creates a number of scatter plots and a couple of useful tables. The tables are written to csv files, to make it easier to copy them into the QA document. They are:
•	A summary of input/output and FBI by farmtype for the two years in the dataset, only considering farms in both year’s data. This makes the two years a bit more comparable in the absence of weightings.
•	A summary of input and output costs, normalised by area or livestock numbers. This allows us to identify trends which can be compared to known industry data.
